# A Neural Network in C!

This project is meant to test if I can actually program in C, and if I truly undestand the underlying concepts behind neural networks.

To do this, I've used the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) of handwritten digits, inspired by the [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks) series on this subject.

## TODO

- Add the softmax derivative to the backpropagation function
- Fix for more layers
